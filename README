.imserviceplugin for iChat which allows people to talk in Campfire rooms.

The IMServicePlugin API and Campfire are not suited for each other. There are several design paradigms which are not compatible between the two. I am doing this to help people produce IMServicePlugin bundles and fill in the documentation vacuum left by Apple.

API documentation can be found here: http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/index

Plugin must be manually installed in /Library/iChat/PlugIns/

Username = <Campfire API key>
Server = "https://domain.campfirenow.com"

Currently, iChat arguably allows me to add a CampfireChat account but it does not seem to interact with my plugin. I suspect this is because I have tested debug builds of the product without code sign signature embedded.
